# Lab 2: Blinky-Buzzy Toy on MSP430 Microcontroller 

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a toy using the MSP430 Microcontroller. Using the knowledge of I/O and Timing simulate a toy with the MSP430 and LCD Button Boosterpack.

This toy:

* Generates sounds.
* Dynamically changes the LEDs that are illuminated, both brighly and dimmly.
* Implements a state machine to maintain the state of the toy.
* Uses the four buttons on the expansion board to transition the state machine.
